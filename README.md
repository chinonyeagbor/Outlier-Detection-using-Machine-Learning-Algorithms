# Outlier-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project explored anomaly detection using machine learning ensemble methods, specifically focusing on the combination of Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Anomaly detection is essential in various domains, including fraud detection, network security, and fault diagnosis.
The aim was to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple algorithms to improve the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection. Isolation Forest is effective at detecting global anomalies in high-dimensional data, LOF excels in identifying local anomalies within clusters, and One-Class SVM provides a hyperplane-based boundary for anomaly detection. The ensemble method combined these models using two strategies: (1) a combined score approach, where anomaly scores from each model are aggregated, and (2) an ensemble agreement approach, where anomalies are identified based on model consensus.

By testing and comparing these methods, we aimed to identify the most effective approach for reliable anomaly detection without ground truth labels.

### Learning Outcomes
Through the course of this project, several key insights and technical skills were developed:

Understanding of Anomaly Detection Algorithms: Gained a deeper understanding of Isolation Forest, LOF, and One-Class SVM algorithms, their strengths, and their limitations in handling different types of anomalies.

Importance of Ensemble Methods: Learned how combining multiple anomaly detection models can enhance detection capabilities, balancing global and local anomaly identification and achieving better performance compared to individual models.

Implementation Skills: Developed practical skills in implementing machine learning models using Python, along with experience in managing and processing data for anomaly detection.

Evaluation Without Ground Truth: Discovered ways to analyze and compare performance of anomaly detection models in the absence of ground truth, using metrics like the number of anomalies detected and overlapping anomaly points between models.

### Conclusion
The ensemble approach to anomaly detection proved effective in enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection by combining multiple models. The combined score method resulted in a higher number of anomalies detected, potentially useful in scenarios where capturing most anomalies is crucial. In contrast, the ensemble agreement method was more conservative, identifying fewer anomalies but with a higher likelihood of being true positives.

While each individual method had its strengths, the ensemble methods provided flexibility in balancing sensitivity and precision. This project demonstrated the practical benefits of using ensemble methods for anomaly detection, especially when working with unlabeled datasets or scenarios where ground truth data is unavailable.

Future work could involve testing these ensemble methods on larger datasets or exploring other anomaly detection models. Additionally, implementing semi-supervised learning with minimal labeled data could further refine the detection capabilities.
